From dimly lit warehouses to underground sewers and high-tech experimental chambers, each level brings unique mechanics and challenges.\n\nThis isn't your typical infiltration platformer. Here, you don’t just control the hero - you also control the surveillance cameras. Navigate the environment, plan your route, and manipulate your field of view as both the infiltrator and the security system.\n\nTo escape, you must use the cameras strategically to piece together the level’s layout. But be warned - not all cameras work in your favor! Some are out to catch you, equipped with motion detection, infrared vision, and even sound-tracking technology.\n\nAs if dodging an army of mechanical eyes wasn’t enough, you’ll also need to master switches, access keycards, and moving platforms to find your way to freedom.\n\nCan you outsmart the system and pull off the heist? Or will you be just another intruder caught on tape?",
